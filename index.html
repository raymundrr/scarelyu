          <h1>Ghost Myths of San Juan, La Union</h1>
          <div class="content" id="content1">
            <p>
              A headless nun, a faceless cigar smoker, a mysterious white lady
              at the old tower—-these are among the spooky tales that itchy
              ghost hunters can pry into during a short stay in the coastal town
              of San Juan, La Union.
            </p>
            <p>
              San Juan was a quiet fishing town of La Union province in the
              North before the Americans came. Most tales are said to have
              originated around this time and handed down to generations. It’s
              still a quiet town, but pompous cottages and mansions have popped
              along its shores.
            </p>
            <p>
              Modernity has caught up among its very old Hispanic buildings,
              with a few shops and inns budding along the main highway. It is an
              8-hour trek from Manila by bus or private car.
            </p>
            <p>
              The eerie tales persist today, though in mumbled whispers by folks
              wistful for the past. The present generation would just shrug
              apathy on them. But now and then fleeting shadows are said to cast
              themselves on a chosen few—-perhaps just for a fun scare.
            </p>
            <p>
              One of the myths goes that old historical ruins of a Spanish
              convent were burned by the Japanese and a nun was killed and
              beheaded. The old ruins of the covenant still stand. On some
              nights when an unfortunate vacationer happens to pass by on a full
              moon at midnight, some bell would toll spookily. It supposedly
              signals the approach of the nun from behind.
            </p>
            <p>
              First it’s a cool, creepy breeze. Then wavy long hair brushing
              against the nape. Looking behind, the victim would discover the
              spooky tale for himself.
            </p>
            <p>
              Another myth is that, before the war, youths around an abandoned
              man-hole used to smoke cigars at midnight. Once, a stranger came,
              face overshadowed by a straw hat, asking for light. When they lent
              a lit cigar, the man looked up to light his, showing a
              spine-chilling blank where a face should have been. The faceless
              man allegedly still shows up, though rarely, because he prefers
              unbranded, native tobacco to imported ones.
            </p>
            <p>
              The pristine beach of San Juan attracts foreign fishers who brag
              on their big catches of sword fish and tuna or "bariles" from the
              sea, which is also ideal for surfing. Old historical ruins of red
              bricks still stand there. It used to be part of a watch tower in
              pre-Hispanic times. A look-out sentry was posted watching out for
              pirates from the China Sea.
            </p>
            <p>
              One of the tales on it says, in an attack, the sentry alerted the
              whole town. A mural on this is painted on one of the walls of the
              town plaza.
            </p>
            <p>
              In recent times, tales say a laughing white lady is said to have
              been showing herself periodically in the old historical ruins,
              especially to handsome young men who brave the seashore at
              midnight.
            </p>
            <p>
              Spooky tales of ghostly nuns, faceless creatures, and laughing
              white ladies may sound absurd and kids-stuff, but there’s always a
              child in us that want to find out. Well, San Juan, La Union is the
              perfect town to go spook-busting while checking out its historical
              old ruins and immaculate azure waters.
